# RULES <br/><br/>



## Selecting a Team: </br>
You will officially be the GM of a team when you name appears next to it in the above list. </br>
Each team will be given a custom 19 yo player named at the request of the GM, at the position chosen by the GM with average stats with a ten point boost in five categories of the GM's choice.

## Timeline: </br>
### Regular Season: </br>

One week of league play will be emulated every workday at 11:00am.</br>

Might change this to multiple weeks per workday with the results posted between each week so GMs have a chance to make changes after each week. <br/>

### Playoffs: </br>

One round of playoffs play will be emulated every workday starting at 11:00am. An issue will be opened for the entirety of the playoffs. Each day will be individually emulated and results will be posted in the issue. Every GM of a team that is still playing will have the chance to make moves before the next day is emulated. The round will be completed before 10:30am the next day regardless of if GMs have had reviewed results.</br>


### Off Season: </br>

Unless requested by a GM each step of the off season will be emulated every workday at 11:00am. </br>

### Exceptions: </br>
If a GM needs more graunlar time steps an issue must be opened before 10:55am with the requested interval for it to take effect. </br> 
*Daily steps will be honored but not if strung togeather excessively*

## Roster Moves: </br>

All Roster moves must be submitted by 10:55am in order to take effect.</br>

To submit a roster move open an issue.</br>

To request a trade open an issue, to agree on a trade both GMs must post an agreement stating what they are giving up and receiving.
To complete a trade with an AI team all other GMs must ok the trade.</br>


To sign a FA a GM must open an issue with the name of the FA and the contract details, how much for how long. If another GM would like to sign that FA they can put in a bid on the player in that same issue. The GM who has offered the most money (years X salary) by the 10:55am deadline will get to sign the FA.
